# GuessingGame

A simple containerized web app made with ReactJS, Go and Docker.

<br/>

First clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:aleandre6579/GuessingGame.git
```
I kept the .env file in the repo for convenience sake but it's bad practice.

<br/>

Then go into the project's root folder and run the docker-compose:
```
cd GuessingGame && docker compose build && docker compose up -d
```

<br/>

Finally visit <a href="http://127.0.0.1" target="_blank">localhost</a>
